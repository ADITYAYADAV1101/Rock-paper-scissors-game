# Rock-paper-scissors-game
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played between the user and the computer. Here, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this game.

This is the intro page of the game and comes for 3 seconds . when we start or restart the game.

This is the game, and we can see the live score and also see what the user chose and what the computer chose.

We have a beautiful restart game button, so when we click on the button, the game will restart.
Thank you for reviewing my game. It was completely made by me.
